Tiny: Tracking People Using Multiple Kinects
======

This repository is a showcase of my, Chi-Jui Wu, Seniour Honours Project in the School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews.

The goals of this project are to develope and evaluate an algorithm which uses multiple Kinects to track people. The algorithm should resolve the problem of occlusion in realistic environments.
