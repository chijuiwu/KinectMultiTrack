Tiny: Tracking People using Multiple Kinects
======

This repository is a showcase of my, Chi-Jui Wu, Seniour Honours Project in the School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews.

The goal of the project is to develop and evaluate an algorithm which tracks people using Multiple Kinects. The algorithm should resolve the problem of occlusion and be used in different environments.

## Working on...

* Literature review (Draft due 14th October, 2014)

* Kinect calibration

## Completed...
