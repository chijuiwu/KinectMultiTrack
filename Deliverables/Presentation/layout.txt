Tracking People using Multiple Kinects

Introduce myself

1. What am I doing?

-Tracking people using multiple Kinects

Introduce the problem

-Parameters
	-Positions of Kinects (overlapping and non-overlapping FOV)
	-Human interactions
		-walk past each other (as a person or as a group)
		-move around in circle
		-move as a group
		-swap positions within a group
	-Occlusion objects
	-Illumination
		-Color normalization can mitigate influence of color variations across cameras
		-Incrementally learn color calibration across camera
	-Indoor and outdoor environments
		-Lab, office, coffee areas

2. Why am I doing it?

2.1 Why Kinect?

-A low-cost sensor for motion capturing and tracking

2.2 Advantages of using multiple Kinects
-A larger FOV
-More precise models of the people in side the view

-Surveillance
	Paper: Intelligent multi-camera video surveillance: A review
-Human activity monitoring
	-Human path prediction
		Paper:　People Tracking with Body Pose Estimation　for Human Path Prediction
	-Remote mapping of blood oxygenation level


3. What others have done?

-RGB
	-Normalization
		-One image of a camera used as the reference target image
		-All other images are transformed to have similar characteristics of that image
		Paper: Color transfer between images
	-Color histogram
		-A representation of the distribution of colors in an image
		Paper: A color histogram based people tracking system
	-Histogram of gradients (HOG)
		-Uses local gradient orientations to describe regions of an image
		Paper: Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection
	-Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
		-Extract interest points to describe local image characteristics
		Paper: Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints
	-Machine learning
		-To learn a model which distinguishes different tracks across cameras
		-Train the weights of local feature descriptors to yield most differences
			-Adboost algorithm
		Paper:　Exploring Context Information for Inter-Camera Multiple Target Tracking

-Infrared
	

-Depth

	Paper: Human detection using depth information by Kinect
	Paper: People detection using color and depth images

4. What do I want to do?

-Calibration
-Record Kinect streams of moving people
-Person re-identification across cameras using RGB, infrared and depth data
	-Model the appearance similarities of a target person against his "neighboring set"
	Paper:　Object tracking across non-overlapping views by learning inter-camera transfer models
	Paper:　Exploring Context Information for Inter-Camera Multiple Target Tracking
-Use contextual cues (appearance and spatio-temporal information) to improve performance
	-How a person different from others within and across groups
-Evaluation of the algorithm
	-Quatitative results
	1. Ratio of people tracked correctly to the total number of people traveling across cameras

	2. Four measures
		-association exist but now shown in tracking
		-association DOES NOT exist but shown in tracking
		-target leaves a camera and returns to the same camera but not shown in tracking
		-target leaves a camera and DOES NOT return to the same camera but shown in tracking
		Paper: Inter-camera association of multi-target tracks by on-line learned appearance 

	3. My ideas:
		Ratio of tracking swaps to the total number of occurrences of people switching positions
