\label{chapter:objectives}

\section{Primary}

The main objective of the current work is to develop an application for tracking people using multiple Kinects. The objective will be achieved through the completion of the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calibration for multiple Kinects
  \item Synchronize the Kinect BodyFrames from multiple Kinects
  \item Merge the 3D coordinate systems from multiple Kinects into a new coordinate system
  \item Recognize a single user by merging the skeletal information from multiple Kinects
  \item Track a single user
\end{enumerate}

\section{Secondary}

The secondary objectives should be completed as part of the work:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Track people under occlusion
  \item Design user studies to evaluate the efficacy of the tracking algorithm
  \item Run the studies
  \item Analyze, report, and discuss the results
  \item Improve the system to track more people reliably
\end{enumerate}
