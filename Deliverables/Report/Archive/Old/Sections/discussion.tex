\subsection{Stationary}

In the Stationary scenario, the average distances over time are generally constant over time. The distances are small (less than five centimeters) in the Parallel and 45 degrees-apart Kinect configurations. The average distances in the 90 degrees-apart Kinect configuration are higher. They are mostly under ten centimeters, but there is a number of joints that have particularly high coordinate differences. In this setting, the large average distances are dominanted by the joints: Elbow Left, Hand Left, Hand Tip Left, Shoulder Left, Thumb Left, and Wrist Left. The left joints are furthest away from the Kinect at the 90 degrees angle.
