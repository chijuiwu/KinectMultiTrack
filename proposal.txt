Project Title
Matching skeletons using multiple Kinects

Research Question
Design and evaluation an application that tracks two or more people using multiple Kinects

Background

Tasks
-Kinect calibration
-Define the distance between the Kinects and their orientations (FOV)
-Make recordings of multiple users walking around and introducing occlusions (multiple recordings, each addressing an issue)
	-One person walking from left to right, from the first Kinect to the next
	-Two people walking toward each other from the opposite end

Aims and Objectives
-Recognize a single user using two Kinects
-Track a single user using two Kinects
-Track two users using two Kinects
-Track up to six users reliably (addresses with occlusion and random movements)
-Track up to six users reliably in different environments (e.g. brightness, distance)

Approach
-Kinect Studio v2 to record sensor data (but cannot record the color stream)
-Use the playback to test the application

Requirements
Two or more Kinects (May require additional PCs if using more than two Kinects)
Large space (For development and testing purposes)
