Project Title
Matching skeletons using multiple Kinects

Research Question
Design and evaluate an application using multiple Kinects to track two or more people.

Background (Previous findings)

High Performance Object Detection by Collaborative Learning of Joint Ranking of Granules Features
	-people detection	

Exploring supporters and distracters in unconstrained environments
	-visual tracker

Persistent People Tracking and Face Capture Over a Wide Area
	-single PTZ camera
	-HD facial images enable biometric analysis
	-multiple cameras with non-overlapping fields of view

	-Problems: maintain identities of people when they move from one camera to another
	-low quality images

	-detect and track people in zoomed-out mode, then selects, using a scheduler, a person to zoom in.
	-come back later to resolve person-to-person, face-to-person and face-to-face data association problem

	-tracking-by-detection + visual tracking
	-camera scheduling

Accurate Motion Deblurring using Camera Motion Tracking and Scene Depth
	-Deblur using depth sensor (Kinect) and IMU sensor with the camera

Pfinder: Real-Time Tracking of the Human Body
	-statistical model of color and shape to segment a person from a background scene

W4S Real-Time System for Detecting and Tracking People in 2 1/2 D
-stereo, shape analysis and tracking, models of people's appearance
-overcome errors and ambiguities arise in dynamic image analysis
	-instability in segmentation processes over time
	-splitting of objects due to coincidental alignment of objects parts with similarly colored background regions
	-work with visible monochromatic video sources (designed for outdoor surveillance)
	-model background scene and detect foreground regions in the intensity image and the disparity image
	-stereo-based detectio handles sudden change in illumination

Tracking Groups of People
	-regions, people, and groups
	-color-based tracking system
	-background subtraction:

Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection [5]
	-Evaluate local histograms of image gradient orientations
		-image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image [Wikipedia]
		-image window divided into small spatial regions (cells), create a histogram of gradient directions over the pixels of the cell
		-contrast-normalize the local histograms
		-normalized descriptor blocks = HOG
		-use linear SVM to do person/non-person classification
	-Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
		-detect & describe local features in images
Tracking people within groups with RGB-D data [2]
	-look at real-time performance for mobile platforms
	-System overview
		-RGB-D data -> voxel grid filter -> ground plane removal -> 3D clustering -> people detection -> detections
		-detections -> likelihoods computation -> joint likelihood data association -> HOG-based initializer -> tracks

	-detection-track done through a maximization of a joint likelihood composed by motion, color appearance and people detection confidence

	-voxel grid filter
		

A color histogram based people tracking system [3]
	-Uses color histogram intersection
	-Histogram intersection value normalized by the total number of pixels in the histogram of the separated person (yields a score between 0 and 1)

Tasks
-Kinect calibration
-Setup
	-The distance between the Kinects and their orientations (FOV)
	-Two basic setups: 1) One in the front and one in the back or 2) one on the left and one on the right
-Read literature and identify algorithms to use. Alternatively, come up with my own algorithm after reading the literature
-Use the Kinect Studio (or the Recording API) to make recordings of multiple users walking around and creating occlusions
	-Multiple recordings, each addressing an issue
	-Use the recordings to demonstrate the program is working (detailed in Aims and Objects)
	-Sample recordings:
		-One person walking from left to right, leaving the FOV of one Kinect into that of another (i.e. extending the Kinect FOV)
		-Two people walking toward each other from the opposite end (i.e. resolve occlusion)
		-More to come

Aims and Objectives
-Literature review
-Calibration (with test targets in some position visible to all the Kinects)
-Recognize a single user using two Kinects
-Track a single user using two Kinects
-Track two users using two Kinects
	-Addresses the problem of occlusion and random movements
-Track two users reliably regardless of the placement of the Kinects (within some boundary)
-Evaluate the system
-Calibration-free (automated calibration, without test targets)
-Track up to six users reliably
-Track up to six users reliably in different environments (e.g. brightness)
-Evaluate the tracking system for six users
-Track up to six users reliably using three machines, each with its own Kinect, in a local network (One additional machine runs the tracking algorithm)
-Evaluate the distributed tracking system

Potential approaches
-To do

Additional information
