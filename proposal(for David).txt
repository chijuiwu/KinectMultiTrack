Project Title
Matching skeletons using multiple Kinects

Research Question
Design and evaluate an application using multiple Kinects to track two or more people.

Background (Previous findings)

Intelligent sensor-scheduling for multi-kinect-tracking [1]
	-
Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection [5]
	-Evaluate local histograms of image gradient orientations
		-image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image [Wikipedia]
Tracking people within groups with RGB-D data [2]
	-HOG-based people detection [5]
	-sub-clustering of depth data
A color histogram based people tracking system [3]
	-Uses color histogram intersection
	-Histogram intersection value normalized by the total number of pixels in the histogram of the separated person (yields a score between 0 and 1)

Tasks
-Kinect calibration
-Setup
	-The distance between the Kinects and their orientations (FOV)
	-Two basic setups: 1) One in the front and one in the back or 2) one on the left and one on the right
-Read literature and identify algorithms to use. Alternatively, come up with my own algorithm after reading the literature
-Use the Kinect Studio (or the Recording API) to make recordings of multiple users walking around and creating occlusions
	-Multiple recordings, each addressing an issue
	-Use the recordings to demonstrate the program is working (detailed in Aims and Objects)
	-Sample recordings:
		-One person walking from left to right, leaving the FOV of one Kinect into that of another (i.e. extending the Kinect FOV)
		-Two people walking toward each other from the opposite end (i.e. resolve occlusion)
		-More to come

Aims and Objectives
-Literature review
-Calibration (with test targets in some position visible to all the Kinects)
-Recognize a single user using two Kinects
-Track a single user using two Kinects
-Track two users using two Kinects
	-Addresses the problem of occlusion and random movements
-Track two users reliably regardless of the placement of the Kinects (within some boundary)
-Evaluate the system
-Calibration-free (automated calibration, without test targets)
-Track up to six users reliably
-Track up to six users reliably in different environments (e.g. brightness)
-Evaluate the tracking system for six users
-Track up to six users reliably using three machines, each with its own Kinect, in a local network (One additional machine runs the tracking algorithm)
-Evaluate the distributed tracking system

Potential approaches
-To do

Additional information
Recordable Data Sources (using Kinect Studio v2)
1. Infrared 13 MB/s
2. Depth 13 MB/s
3. BodyFrame (Record only)
4. BodyIndex (Record only)
5. Color 120 MB/s (Not in public preview)
6. Audio 32 KB/s

Applications
Multiple users to control the facial expressions of their respective virtual avatars [4]
Possible: blood oxygenation level of multiple people

Requirements
Two or more Kinects (May require additional PCs if using more than two Kinects)
Large space (For development and testing purposes)
