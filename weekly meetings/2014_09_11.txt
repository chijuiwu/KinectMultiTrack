What I did last week?
Read paper(s)
Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection [5]
	-human detection from images
	-HOG (mentioned in many papers) is the local histograms of image gradient orientations
	-might not be so useful as I know how to use the Kinect to separate a human body from the background as well as body parts that belong to other people

Tracking people within groups with RGB-D data [2]

Ideas
	-Computational time needed by the algorithm (to process each frame for tracking) in different settings

What I am going to do this week?
-Read more papers on tracking people using RGB-D data
-How to capture images while people are moving (or any post-processing to reduce fuzziness)

Questions
-Description, Objectives, Ethics and Resources due in two weeks (Draft next week)
-A deadline for the literature review (Week 5)

David mentioned...
-Depth data calibration

Todo
-DOER and Ethics draft ready for next Thursday (weekly meeting at 2pm)
-Literature review presentation in Week 3
